# Fast Ricochet Robots with real time feedback.

Part of the fun of Ricochet Robots is holding all of the moves in your head, but I think it would be
cool to see how fast the game can get with computer aids, and real time feedback.

# Some thoughts

- Robots move in straight lines until they hit walls or other robots.
- The goal is to move one of the four robots to a specified square on the grid in the least number of moves.
- After a player finds a solution the other players have one minute to find a shorter solution.
  At the end of the minute countdown the player with the shortest solution will get the point.

- Players can move the robots around their own boards in real time, any solution they find will
  be submitted automatically.
- All previous moves are recorded and listed.
- The length of other players shortest solution is displayed.


# Questions
- Should robots be animated, or instantly move to the final block of their move.
- Hardcore anim√© explosions when solutions are found?

## Controls
- One set of keys for each robot?
  q,w,e,r
  a,s,d,f
  j,k,l,; / h,j,k,l
  u,i,o,p / y,u,i,o
- One set of keys for all robots, cycle through robots?
- Touchscreen input, swipe robots to send them along a path?
